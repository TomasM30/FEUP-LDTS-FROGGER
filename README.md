# LDTS_Turma4_Grupo5 - Frogger Game

## INTRODUCTION

In this simple and classic game, the player will help a little frog cross numerous adversities in order to reach its final destination. Our little friend will need to navigate its way through a road full of all types of vehicles without getting hit and surpass the dangers of a hazardous river.

This project was develop by Tomás Martins (up202108776@fe.up.pt), João Lima (up202108891@fe.up.pt) and João Belchior (up202108777@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2022/23.

## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- **Move to any direction** - The game character will move forward, left, right and backward pressing the "W","A","D" and "S" keys respectively

- **Dangerous vehicles** - There will be a stage of moving vehicles that will pose a threat to our main character if he collides with them. These vehicles will be cars or trucks of different sizes and move at different speeds

- **Hazardous river** - In this stage there will be two types of moving objects. There will be floating logs of wood that will work as moving platforms to the frog, and there will be lily pads that will work the same as the floating logs

- **Health counter** - Our frog will be able to reach its destination within 3 tries. If it colides against a car or a truck, or even if it falls into the river, the frog will be spawned to the starting position losing a heart each time it happens until it is left with none
